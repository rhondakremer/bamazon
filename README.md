bamazonCustomer.js 
This is a shopping app. Items with prices are populated from a mySQL database. Using Inquirer, the user is prompted to pick an item ID number and the quantity they would like to buy. If the item number is valid and the quantity exists, the quantity is subtracted and updated to mySQL and the total is presented to the user along with a success message. If one of the two conditions is not met, an error message populates and the user is prompted to select an item and quantity again. After a successful purchase, the user is asked if he or she would like to purchase another item. If yes, the process repeats. If no, the connection is ended.
